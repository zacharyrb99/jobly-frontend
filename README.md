## Requirements 
1. NPM

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, it is straight forward thanks to NPM:
`npm i`

## Start
NPM makes it easy to spin up the backend server: 
`npm start`

## Features:
1. Log in or sign up
    - I chose to make the app require a user to log in to use most of its features. This simplified the applying feature for jobs. The only thing you will be able to do while anonymous is view the homepage. 
2. Search companies or jobs.
    - I set the search funtionality up to be able to allow users to search for a company/jobs based on company size, salary or equity.
3. Apply to jobs
    - This feature allows users to easily apply for a job they found interesting.
4. Update user profile
    - This will allow a user to change their name and email, and requires password authentication. User currently aren't able to change their username or password. Currently bugged, working on a fix now.
